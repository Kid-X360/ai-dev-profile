NekoPulse Technologies is an AI-based creative technology project founded by Sphamandla Mtungwa. We focus on building intelligent virtual assistants, character-based AIs, and tools for interactive user experiences inspired by anime and neural technology.

Our project is currently hosted and maintained via GitHub Pages, with a public-facing website at https://github.com/Kid-X360/ai-dev-profile/blob/main/README.md, where we share project details, contact info, and updates.
